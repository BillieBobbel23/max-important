# Max !important
!important, the very best there is. When you absolutely, positively got to override every selectah in the room, accept no substitutes.

## But why?
Well, sometimes using !important is not enough, "Max !important" makes it possible to specify how important your selector actually is. By appending extra exclamation marks to your important you can directly control the amount of weight any important has. Making it a very versatile way of overriding anything anytime.

Say you want to override an !important, "Max !important", simply appends an extra ! in front of it (!!important) and you're done. Easy as Pi.

## Seriously though, why?
Specicifity is hard. What do you do when you encounter an !important declaration in a codebase but you want to override it? Inline styling makes a mess so a method for specifying how important an important declaration is seems like a must. This is how "Max !important" came to be.

## Have you been drinking?
Yes, but that's not the point. "Max !important" solves all those pesky specicifity issues and adds completely unwanted new ones on top of that.

## You've got to be kidding me?
Yeah, maybe I am.... Or am I?
